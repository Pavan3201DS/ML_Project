# Simple Linear Regression on Salary Dataset


This repository contains a simple implementation of linear regression on a salary dataset. The goal of this project is to predict the salary of an individual based on their years of experience using a simple linear regression model.


## Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

* Python
* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* matplotlib


## Implementation

The implementation consists of the following steps:

1. Data Loading: Load the dataset using pandas.
2. Data Exploration: Visualize the dataset to understand the relationship between years of experience and salary.
3. Data Preprocessing: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. Model Training: Train a simple linear regression model on the training data.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model on the testing data using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R-squared.
6. Visualization: Visualize the regression line and actual vs. predicted salaries.


## Results

The results of the simple linear regression model are displayed in the google collab. These results include metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R-squared, as well as visualizations of the regression line and actual vs. predicted salaries.


## Understanding the Results
The output of the script will provide insights into the relationship between salary and the predictor variable. Key components of the results include:

Regression Coefficients: These coefficients indicate the slope and intercept of the regression line.
Regression Line Plot: A visualization showing the regression line fitted to the data points.
Statistical Metrics: Metrics such as R-squared value, mean squared error, etc., are provided to assess the goodness of fit of the regression model.
